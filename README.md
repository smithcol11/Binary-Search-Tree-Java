# Binary-Search-Tree-Java
A Binary Search Tree that utilizes abstract classes in Java. For my Data Structures class, I had to work in Java as opposed to C++. So, this was a great challenge to convert my current knowledge of BSTs and apply them in a new syntax. This program abstractly hold services in an array, similar to a notice board. This data is also written to file for later reading.
